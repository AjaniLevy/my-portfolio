# Beginning CSS-Challenges
 
Use these challenges here to get started with CSS. 

The file here came from the HTML markup challenges. If you've done those you'll recognize some of the examples. 

## What to do?

Work your way through each of the challenge files. Open each file in your browser, read the comments in the style tag at the top and follow the instructions. Then refresh your browser. 

As you make changes you'll be applying CSS styles to the documents you previously marked up.
